# Fix: Main Page Not Showing Products from Supabase

## Problem Identified

The main page wasn't showing products from Supabase because the `useProducts` hook was configured to use mock data instead of fetching from the database.

## Root Cause

In `app/hooks/useProducts.ts`, the code was set up to skip database queries and use mock data:

```typescript
console.log("‚ö†Ô∏è  Database queries are timing out, using mock data instead...");

// Skip database queries since they're timing out
// Use mock data directly to avoid console errors
```

## Solution Applied

I've updated the `useProducts` hook to actually fetch products from Supabase:

```typescript
console.log("‚úÖ Supabase environment variables configured");
console.log("üîÑ Fetching products from Supabase...");

// Fetch products from Supabase
let query = supabase.from("products").select("*");

if (selectedCategory !== "all") {
  query = query.eq("Category", selectedCategory);
}

const { data: productsData, error: productsError } = await query;

if (productsError) {
  console.error("‚ùå Error fetching products:", productsError);
  throw productsError;
}

console.log("‚úÖ Products fetched from Supabase:", productsData?.length || 0);
setProducts(productsData || []);
```

## What This Fixes

- ‚úÖ **Real Data**: Main page now shows actual products from your Supabase database
- ‚úÖ **Category Filtering**: Products are properly filtered by category
- ‚úÖ **Live Updates**: Changes in the database will reflect on the main page
- ‚úÖ **Proper Grouping**: Products are grouped by category and product name
- ‚úÖ **Fallback**: Still uses mock data if database fails

## Verification Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** to get the updated code
2. **Check the console** - you should see:
   - "‚úÖ Supabase environment variables configured"
   - "üîÑ Fetching products from Supabase..."
   - "‚úÖ Products fetched from Supabase: [number]"
3. **Check the main page** - you should now see your actual products from the database
4. **Test category filtering** - try selecting different categories

## Expected Results

After the fix:
- Main page shows products from your Supabase `products` table
- Products are grouped by category (Dried Chilli, etc.)
- Each product shows variations (2", 4", 60-70, etc.)
- Category filtering works properly
- Search functionality works with real data

## Troubleshooting

If you still don't see products:

1. **Check Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify Database**: Make sure your `products` table has data
3. **Check RLS Policies**: Ensure RLS policies allow reading products
4. **Environment Variables**: Verify Supabase credentials are set

## Database Requirements

Make sure your `products` table has the expected structure:
- `id` (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- `Product` (TEXT)
- `Category` (TEXT or INTEGER)
- `price` (DECIMAL)
- `Variation` (TEXT)
- `stock_quantity` (INTEGER)
- Other fields as needed

The main page should now display your actual products from Supabase!
