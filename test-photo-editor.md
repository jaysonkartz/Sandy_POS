# Photo Editor Test Guide

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

1. **Infinite Loading**: Fixed by creating proper placeholder images and better error handling
2. **404 Errors**: Created `/public/product-placeholder.svg` to prevent missing image errors
3. **Loading States**: Added proper loading indicators and fallback logic

## üß™ **How to Test the Photo Editor**

### **Step 1: Verify Setup**

1. Make sure you have the Cloudinary environment variables set:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_preset_name
   ```

2. Install the cloudinary package:

   ```bash
   npm install cloudinary
   ```

3. Update your database schema:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN image_url TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW();
   ```

### **Step 2: Test the Photo Editor**

1. **Navigate to Product Management**:
   - Go to `/management/products`
   - You should see products with proper images or placeholders

2. **Test Photo Upload**:
   - Click the camera icon on any product
   - Try uploading an image (JPG, PNG, or GIF under 5MB)
   - Verify the upload progress shows
   - Check that the image appears after upload

3. **Test Error Handling**:
   - Try uploading a file that's too large (>5MB)
   - Try uploading a non-image file
   - Verify error messages appear

4. **Test Image Display**:
   - Check that products with custom images show a "Custom" badge
   - Verify fallback to static images works
   - Confirm placeholder images show for missing images

### **Step 3: Verify No More 404 Errors**

Check your browser console - you should no longer see:

```
GET /product-placeholder.png 404
```

Instead, you should see proper loading states and fallback images.

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **If images still don't load:**

1. **Check Cloudinary Setup**:
   - Verify your Cloudinary credentials are correct
   - Make sure your upload preset exists and is configured for "Unsigned" uploads

2. **Check Database**:
   - Ensure the `image_url` column exists in your products table
   - Verify you have proper permissions to update the products table

3. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Make sure all Cloudinary variables are set in `.env.local`
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### **If you see loading spinners forever:**

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the ProductImage component is working correctly
3. Make sure the placeholder SVG file exists at `/public/product-placeholder.svg`

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**

‚úÖ **Working Correctly:**

- Products display with images or proper placeholders
- No 404 errors in console
- Photo editor opens when clicking camera icon
- Upload progress shows during image upload
- Custom images show "Custom" badge
- Error messages appear for invalid uploads

‚ùå **Still Broken:**

- Infinite loading spinners
- 404 errors in console
- Photo editor doesn't open
- Upload fails without error message

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure the database schema is updated
4. Try uploading a small test image first

The photo editor should now work smoothly without infinite loading or 404 errors!
